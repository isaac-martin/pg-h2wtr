        <p class="desert-text text-center">
          The refreshing taste and hydrating awesomeness of watermelon water had long been a friend of David Freedman’s, founder of H2coco. Having quenched more than a few thirsts with watermelon water in Thailand, it wasn’t until David found himself wandering the Nevada Desert that he discovered the brilliance of cold pressed watermelon juice. So it’s fair to say David had been a convert of this heavenly fruit’s goodness long before our story unfolded.

          <h2 class="text-center">A summer fail of epic proportions</h2>
          <p class="col-text white">
On a sweltering Sydney summer days our brand founder David Freeman and his best mate are walking down Hall Street Bondi with a cooling arvo swim in their sights.
Along their sun-drenched walk they pass a fruit shop where their eyes covet a perfectly ripe and sizeable watermelon. Upon agreeing that slicing up nature’s most hydrating fruit on the beach would be an act of thirst-quenching genius, they purchase the mother of all watermelons. After feverishly trying to fit the 9 kilo fruit into a backpack which now has both zippers and the very bottom torn out of it – the boys soon share the job of carrying it down the street like an overfed baby and finally onto the shore.
With their swim done, the boys are cooled on the outside but their insides need some serious hydrating. As they prepare to get stuck into that juicy beast, the crushing reality hits – they don’t have anything to cut it open with!
The boys are hot, sweaty and feeling defeated by the fact that their only thirst relief is literally trapped inside an impenetrable shell. It’s a summer fail of epic proportions.
During that long walk home, and with the weight of a massive watermelon on his shoulders, David conjures up a vision of what would soon become H2Melon – a hydrating and cleansing drink that captures the goodness and thirst-busting wonder that only a watermelon offers.
