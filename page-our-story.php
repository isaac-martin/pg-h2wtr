        <p class="desert-text text-center">
          The refreshing taste and hydrating awesomeness of watermelon water had long been a friend of David Freeman’s, founder of H2Coco. Having quenched more than a few thirsts with watermelon water in Thailand, it wasn’t until David found himself wandering the Nevada Desert that he discovered the brilliance of cold pressed watermelon water, but visioned H2melon a little differently .  So it’s fair to say David had been a convert of this heavenly fruit’s goodness long before our story unfolded.

          <h2 class="text-center">With the weight of the melon on his shoulders</h2>
          <p class="col-text white">
            Picture it; one of those sweltering Sydney summer days and our brand founder David Freeman and his best mate are walking down Hall Street Bondi with a cooling arvo swim in their sights.
            Along their sun-drenched walk they pass a fruit shop where their eyes covet a perfectly ripe and sizeable watermelon. Upon agreeing that slicing up one of nature’s most hydrating fruit on the beach would be an act of thirst-quenching genius, they purchase the mother of all watermelons.
            After feverishly trying to fit the 9 kilo(this needs to be checked, seems to heavy) fruit into a backpack – which now has both zippers and the very bottom torn out of it – the boys soon share the job of carrying it down the street like an overfed baby and finally onto the shores of Bondi Beach.

            With their swim done, the boys are cooled on the outside but their insides need some serious hydrating. As they prepare to get stuck into that juicy beast, the crushing reality hits – they don’t have anything to cut it open with!

            The boys are hot, sweaty and feeling defeated by the fact that their only thirst relief is literally trapped inside an impenetrable shell.

            During that long walk home, and with the weight of a massive watermelon on his shoulders, David conjures up a vision of what would soon become H2melon – a hydrating and cleansing drink that captures the goodness and thirst-busting wonder that only a watermelon offers.
            This lightning bolt moment leads to the obsessive study of watermelons inside and out. Did you know there is 1200 types of Watermelon on earth?

          </p>
          <h2 class="text-center">A convenient go anywhere drink!</h2>
          <p class="white desert-text text-center">
            After David forensically studied thirty-three watermelon varieties and 12 months later, H2melon is born  – a convenient go anywhere drink that doesn’t require a knife, packed into an environmentally friendly tetra pak that maintains its freshness for 12 months!

<br />The rest is history, well very modern history at least.
